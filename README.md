## 1. Industry Context
The consumer lending sector is a critical component of the financial services industry, providing individuals with access to credit for various purposes such as buying a car, financing education, consolidating debt, or improving homes.

Effective management of loan portfolios is essential for financial institutions to mitigate risks, enhance profitability, and ensure customer satisfaction.

With the increasing complexity of consumer lending, advanced data analysis techniques are vital for understanding borrower behavior, assessing loan risk profiles, and making informed strategic decisions.

## 2. Objective
